# Dawnguard Dialogue Bundle

Durak asks you if you want to join the dawnguard. Add an option for being knowledgeable about the Dawnguard:

> "The Dawnguard? I thought they were disbandoned years ago."
- They were. But now Isran is bringing it back. Go talk to him at Fort Dawnguard, southeast of Riften. He'll decide if you're Dawnguard material.
	- > Isn't the Vigilants taking care of this?
		- Hah, the Vigilants. They're not trained for this kind of thing.

If you talk to Durak when you're at Fort Dawnguard, you can ask him what he's shooting with. This mod adds a new option of already knowing what he's shooting with:

> "I've never seen a crossbow like that before."
- Nothing better for putting down vampires. Here, take this one and give it a try. You'll want to get to know how to use it if you really plan to join the Dawnguard.

## Agmaer

For my previous mod Companions Dialogue Bundle, I spent a lot of time on fleshing out Skjor. In Dawnguard Dialgoue Bundle, Agmaer has recieved most of my focus. You meet Agmaer in Dayspring Canyon when you first go to Fort Dawnguard. He's a farm boy with no experience and I wanted the player to e able to interact with him a bit more, help him & see his progression. He has also gained a little bit more of a backstory to make him more interesting.

This dialogue will show up if _JQ_InitiateAgmaer is 0 & you have completed Dimhollow Crypt.

> "That armor looks a lot safer than the farm clothes you wore earlier." (GlobalVariable: _JQ_InitiateAgmaer = 1)
- Aye, it does, doesn't it? I never thought I'd be wearing armor like this. 

	> "How are things going for you here?"
	- It hasn't been easy. I've never even seen a vampire before I came here. I've never even seen a crossbow before. But I'm not going to let that stop me. I'll do whatever it takes to help Isran defeat those monsters.

		> "You get used to it. Let me know if you need any help."
		- Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
		
		> "That's the spirit!"

		> "Sure, if you say so..."

Once _JQ_InitiateAgmaer is set to 1, Agmaer will have a new dialogue option:

> "How are things going for you here?"
- 

Agmaer misc dialogue will include:

- "I killed a vampire yesterday. I can't believe it."
- "Fort Dawnguard is amazing. I've never seen anything like it."
- "I can't believe I'm a member of the Dawnguard. I never thought I'd be a vampire hunter."
- "I wonder if I could use two crossbows at the same time. One in each hand..."
- "Come on, Agmaer. You can do this. You can do this. Sorry I was just thinking out loud."
- ""
